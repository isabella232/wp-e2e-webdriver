wp-e2e-webdriver
================

Webdriver manager and helper for WordPress. Most of the good stuff were shamelessly
copied from [wp-e2e-tests](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-e2e-tests). Thanks to
wp-e2e-tests authors and contributors for providing the foundation!

This package provides WebDriver manager and helper to help you test WordPress
site.

## Dependents

The reason we pulled out manager and helper from wp-e2e-tests so that following
dependents can use that:

* wp-e2e-page-objects &mdash; Repo will be published later. WordPress Page Objects
  package
* WooCommerce extensions that will have e2e tests that use wp-e2e-page-objects
